# Seinfeld Trivia App
Working on a Seinfeld fan trivia app to put in practice Flows, Retrofit, JSON, Room.
I also scrap the scripts from a website and take some random lines.

### Script Screen
Can you guess the correct episode?

Here I scrap the script on the fly and take a random fragment to be guess by the user

### Quiz Screen
Now implementing a Quiz Screen calling a JSON file to get questions and answers. Lottie Animation applied for the answer result.

### Lines Screen:
From the random script uscase I get 3 random lines from the 4 main charachters in an episode so the user have to drag and drop the line to it's author.
Here I applied Jetpack Compose for the drag and drop and a marquee Text View for the episode hint.
